tl;dr “<” to trigger org block completion at point.

Like [[https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block][company-org-block]], but for =completion-at-point= users who'd like similar funcitonality without the [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]] dependency.

Check out [[https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block][company-org-block]] to get a feel for the functionality and capabilities.

To enable =org-block-capf=, add it to the =completion-at-point-functions= in org-mode, which you can do via:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'org-block-capf)

  (org-block-capf-add-to-completion-at-point-functions)
#+end_src
Then, completing the “<” via =complete-symbol= / =completion-at-point= in org-mode should let you select an org block.

Alternatively, you can use =M-x org-block-capf= as an interactive command to complete “<”, which doesn't require the above setup, as it uses itself as a completion-at-point-function.
