tl;dr “<” to trigger org block completion at point.

Like [[https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block][company-org-block]], but for =completion-at-point= users who'd like similar funcitonality without the [[https://company-mode.github.io/][company]] dependency.

Check out [[https://github.com/xenodium/company-org-block][company-org-block]] to get a feel for the functionality and capabilities.

You can enable =org-block-capf= by adding it to =completion-at-point-functions= or you can invoke =org-block-capf-add-to-completion-at-point-functions=
as follows:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :lexical no
  (require 'org-block-capf)

  (org-block-capf-add-to-completion-at-point-functions)
#+end_src
